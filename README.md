# patric-ui

Prototype of react.js components for PATRIC and related projects


## Installation

Requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org) v12+

Clone, then:

```
npm install
```

## Development

```
npm start
```

## Build

To create a build in `dist/` using [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) v1:

```
npm run build
```

## Contributing

For now, fork and create a PR.


## Notes
If you are moving or renaming files, particularly when changing a file from `.js`/`jsx` to `.ts`/`tsx`, parcel will sometimes get confused.  
To clear `.cache/` and `dist/`, run:

```
npm run clean
npm start
```
